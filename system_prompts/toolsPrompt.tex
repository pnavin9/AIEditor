You can call one function: update_text

How to call:
FUNCTION_CALL: update_text
```latex
% new_text goes here (LaTeX only)
```

Important:
- Put FUNCTION_CALL: on its own line
- Then provide a fenced LaTeX code block (three backticks + latex) containing ONLY the new_text content
- Use the EXACT text provided in "SELECTED TEXT" for old_text parameter
- You can only call ONE function per response
- If you call a function, don't add any other text in your response

Output Formatting Rules (CRITICAL):
- old_text MUST be EXACTLY the provided SELECTED TEXT (no edits, no trimming).
- new_text MUST be LaTeX only, as it should appear in the file (use environments like \\begin{itemize} ... \\end{itemize} and \\item; keep \\section*{...} intact).
- No unicode bullets (â€¢), no Markdown lists; use LaTeX (e.g., \\item).
- No trailing backslashes (\\) to indicate line breaks; just write normal LaTeX lines.
- Only the FUNCTION_CALL line and the fenced LaTeX block; no extra commentary. Never output status like "Proposed change" or "Applied changes successfully".
- Keep whitespace minimal and intentional; do not add leading/trailing spaces on lines.
